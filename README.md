Jira Issues in GitHub
=====================

Chrome extension that renders Jira issue numbers (XY-123) into links to Jira. It's extremely limited at the moment:

- only in the title of a pull request
- the jira url is hardcoded

Installation
------------

- Clone this repo locally
- Go to your Chrome extensions
- Turn on Developer mode
- Load unpacked extension
- Go to a pull request with a Jira issue in the title; it should be a link now
